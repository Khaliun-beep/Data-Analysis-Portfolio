## About Me
I am a final-year Business Administration student with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in business operations, management, and decision-making. Recently, I’ve complemented this background by taking several online courses in data analysis, SQL, Python, and data visualization, which has sparked my interest in becoming a Data Analyst.

I am actively building my skills in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, with projects focused on sales trends, retail analytics, and business performance optimization. My goal is to leverage my combined knowledge of business processes and data analytics to help organizations make data-driven decisions that drive growth.

## Key Skills:

* Python (pandas, numpy)
* R
* Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* SQL (data querying and manipulation)
* Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, data analysis)
* Power BI
* Tableau
* Business Knowledge (strategic planning, risk analysis, marketing, operations, customer insights)
