## About Me
I'm a Business Administration graduate student with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in business operations, management, and decision-making. Recently, I’ve complemented this background by taking several online courses in data analysis, SQL, Python, and data visualization, which has sparked my interest in becoming a Data Analyst.

I am actively building my skills in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, with projects focused on sales trends, retail analytics, and business performance optimization. My goal is to leverage my combined knowledge of business processes and data analytics to help organizations make data-driven decisions that drive growth.

E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis with SQL <a href="https://github.com/Khaliun-beep/Projects/blob/main/ecommerce-customer-behavior.sql" target="_blank" style="display: inline-block; padding: 8px 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #fff; background-color: #007bff; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px;">Click Here</a>


**Project Overview:** This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior data from an e-commerce platform to understand customer segmentation, satisfaction levels, and purchase patterns. The goal of the analysis is to segment customers based on their behavior and provide actionable insights that can help enhance retention strategies and optimize marketing efforts.

**Dataset:**

(Customer ID, Gender, Age, City, Membership Type, Total Spend, Items Purchased, Average Rating, Discount Applied, Days Since Last Purchase, Satisfaction Level)

**Tools and Technologies:**

- **SQL:** The primary language used to query and analyze the dataset.
- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system used for handling the data.
- **DBeaver:** A universal SQL client used for querying the database and performing data manipulation.
- **Tableau:** Data visualization
- 
**Key Insights:**

**Customer Segmentation:** Based on membership type (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and satisfaction levels. This segmentation provides insights into which groups are more likely to be loyal customers and which require targeted marketing efforts.

**Spending Patterns by City:** SQL queries revealed that cities like San Francisco and New York generate the highest revenue, while cities like Chicago show higher satisfaction but lower spending.

**Time-Based Behavior:** Customers who haven’t purchased recently (more than 60 days) are categorized as non-active. They might need to be targeted with re-engagement campaigns.

**Visualizations:** Tableau Dashboards

*Dashboard 1:* City-Wise Customer Ratings and Discount Impact
**Bar Chart:** Displays average customer ratings by city, showcasing how different cities (Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and San Francisco) perform in terms of customer satisfaction.
**Bubble Chart:** Compares total spend with days since the last purchase by city, segmented by whether a discount was applied. This helps identify whether discounts influence spending and how long customers have gone without making a purchase.
*Dashboard 2:* Customer Segmentation and Loyalty Analysis
**Scatter Plot:** Segments customers by loyalty status and satisfaction level across membership types (Bronze, Gold, and Silver), highlighting which groups are more satisfied or unsatisfied with their experience.
**Bar Chart:** Displays total spend by membership type and satisfaction level, emphasizing which customer groups contribute the most to total revenue based on their membership and satisfaction.
**Bubble Chart:** Analyzes total spend with days since the last purchase, segmented by whether a discount was applied, showing which segments are influenced by discounts.
